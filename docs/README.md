## **Important Notes**

1. **Task Identifiers**:
    - When referencing tasks (for updating, marking, or deleting), use their **index** in the list.

## **Tips for Using ChatBuddy**

1. **Realistic Data**: When adding tasks, try to input real data. Instead of "Test task", use actual task names like "Complete homework" or "Prepare for exam".
2. **Navigation**: Use the `list` command regularly to see the updated task statuses.
